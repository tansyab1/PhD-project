* Folder `Examples` includes some code source as a library to use for any experiment.
* Folder `Source` is the implemtation on Python language. In which, folder `pre-processing` contains back-end functions for distortion generation. Folder `Classification` stores registered template for classification. Folder `DataGeneration` defines some essential paths to split the data used for classification and generate anotation from HyperKvasir dataset.
