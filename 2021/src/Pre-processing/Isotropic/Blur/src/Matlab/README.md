# Image-denoise-and-TV-solver
Image de-noising using FISTA and MFISTA algorithms and 1D L1 and L2 solver

## Description
The image denoising problem is solved using FISTA and MFISTA

The denoise folder contains 2 solvers for image denoise:
  - FISTA
  - MFISTA

The denoise folder contains 2 solvers for TV (Total variation):
  - TV l1 (1D)
  - TV l2 (1D)


## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository. Run the denoise_test.m to check FISTA (fast iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm) and MFISTA (monotonic fast iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm) algorithm. 

Run the TV_solve_test.m to check the various l1 and l2 solvers for the total variation problems in 1D.

### Prerequisites

Matlab 2010 or higher
